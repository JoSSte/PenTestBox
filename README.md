# PenTestBox

This Repo is a vagrantfile witth a Kali Box to enable pentesting and security analysis. Setup with all the tools I deem necessary to allow easy analysis.  

The Ubuntu tagged commit is from an earlier edition where my goal was just to have an linux VM to spin up quickly for diferent tasks.
